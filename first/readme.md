## **Technical Description and Key Steps**

### Controller Layer

*   **Responsibility**:
    *   The controller does not involve any business logic. It is solely responsible for routing HTTP requests to the appropriate services and returning responses.

### Service Layer

*   **Business Logic Division**:
    *   The service layer's business logic is divided into three main parts, addressing different aspects of the coffee service functionality:

#### 1. April Fool's Day Handling

*   **Functionality**: On April 1st, any request to brew coffee will return an HTTP 418 (I'm a teapot) status, indicating that no coffee will be brewed on this day.

#### 2. Coffee Consumption Limit

*   **Functionality**: The service allows up to five coffee brewing requests before indicating that the coffee supply is depleted. After five uses, it returns an HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) status.

#### 3. Normal Coffee Brewing

*   **Implementation**: The standard coffee brewing process is encapsulated within the `CoffeeResponseGeneratorImpl` class, allowing for easy modification of the brewing logic in the future without affecting other parts of the service.

### Singleton Configuration in `Program.cs`

*   **Code Implementation**:
    ```C#
    `builder.Services.AddSingleton<ICoffeeService, CoffeeServiceImpl>();`
    `builder.Services.AddSingleton<ICoffeeResponseGenerator, CoffeeResponseGeneratorImpl>();`
    ```
*   **Purpose**: Configuring both `CoffeeServiceImpl` and `CoffeeResponseGeneratorImpl` as singletons minimizes resource utilization and operational costs but introduces the necessity for thread safety due to shared instances across multiple requests.

### Thread Safety Solution

*   **Implementation**:
    ```C#
    `lock (LockObject)`
    `{`
        `_requestCount++;`
        `currentCount = _requestCount;`
    `}`
    ```
*   **Explanation**: Ensures that updates to `_requestCount` are thread-safe, preventing simultaneous modifications by multiple threads which could lead to inconsistent states.

### Object-Oriented Design Principles Demonstrated

1.  **Liskov Substitution Principle**:
    *   The `ICoffeeResponseGenerator` interface ensures that any future changes in the coffee brewing logic can be handled by substituting different implementations without disrupting existing functionality.

2.  **Dependency Inversion Principle**:
    *   High-level modules (like controllers) do not depend on low-level modules (like specific services) but on abstractions (interfaces). Similarly, the service layer depends on the generator interface, not on specific implementations.

3.  **Single Responsibility Principle**:
    *   The controller is solely responsible for handling requests and delegating to services, not for business logic. The service handles business logic but delegates flexible or volatile logic to the generator class, minimizing impact on other components.

4.  **Interface Segregation Principle**:
    *   Interfaces are specifically tailored to client needs. The service interface is designed to provide only the functionalities required by the controller, without extraneous methods that the controller does not use.
